what_i_learned: |
   I learned about git and github, Git is a version control system, and Github is a website that allows Git to run and helps with multiple codebases. I also learned a lot of what the program would be like today. Took a placement test which was interesting to say the least. Got to meet everyone through zoom that's in my cohort and interacted with my group. played jepoardy which was very fun to do as well.

  

blockers: |
   Took a while to upload my information on the website.

reflection: |
   It was like a refresher course for me I had a solid understanding of what github and git are for so it's best to be able to learn what I did and better boost my skills. I liked meeting everyone in my cohort and group. When it came down to it the first virtual day was fun to deal with when we started playing the bingo and jepoardy. Overall a very solid first day.
