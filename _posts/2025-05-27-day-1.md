what_i_learned: |
   I learned about git and github, Git is a version control system, and Github is a website that allows Git to run and helps with multiple codebases. I also learned a lot of what the program would be like today.

  

blockers: |
  Took a while to upload my information on the website.

reflection: |
  It was like a refresher course for me I had a solid understanding of what github and git are for so it's best to be able to learn what I did and better boost my skills.
