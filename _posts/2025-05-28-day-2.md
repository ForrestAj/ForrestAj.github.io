what_i_learned: |
  I learned a lot about python and got a much needed refresher, I already knew most of the intro stuff but I'm hoping we get into the those rusty parts soon. We also got to meet our mentors and learn a lot about how the program will work and it's espcially fun to get into that soon. Updated the website of any errors that were trouble. We go started on our interactive websites where we'll be communicating with each other. Meeting our mentors was very informative.



blockers: |
  No Blockers as of today still in the introductory phase of things.
  
reflection: |
  I realized that my main issue with programming is just the intense over thinking going on and I realized that I just need to work on that problem more. I also like the way were being guided into this program just so that we get a better understanding of things going on. I liked building my website as the website was a breather with everything else going on within the day. Overall okay day nothing really exciting yet.
