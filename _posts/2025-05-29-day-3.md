what_i_learned: |
   Computer Vision is the process of giving a computer human-like vision. Their tasks are Image Classifaction, Object Detection, Object Tracking, Image Segmentation. I also learned about the YOLO V8 model as being a part of helping the computer vision. I also played an escape room game which was fun and entertaining. The escape room was very interactive to work on as me and my team completed the task and made significant progress. In the python course we learned about variables, and how and input and output works.

  

blockers: |
  Got stuck on the definition of a tuple because I thought tuples had to have more than one thing ().

reflection: |
   This was a very productive day as of today, espcially because I got to learn something knew and need a refresher as time goes on. My coding anxiety comes from overthinking reading it is one thing actiually doing it is another. I also liked our computer vision course for today gave me something I might want to shift my focus on as I progress as an educated.
