what_i_learned: |
  We learned about what a conditional was, and if can't be overwritten, if statements are to determine if something ends up being either true or false. Also if/else statements where some is either True or False. New thing we learned about aswell is booleans determining if they're True or False. We also currently learned about logical operators like and, not, or. Generative AI and how it's used like Open AI, Eleven Labs, Github Copliot in order to create new content. Learning how AI has evolved over the years from 1957 to 2021. Machine Learning is highlighting making prediction without programming so it can detect patterns.

reflection: |
   I enjoyed the lesson about Generative AI, it opened my eyes to being able how to recognize the patterns that work around humans and what's going on. I want to be able to get into deep learning and enhancing my knowledge on how these multi layered patterns are used to recognized complex algorithms. I like our kahoot games even though my phone gave out mid way. I definitely have to think some things through with bot or not.
