what_i_learned: |
    I learned that when it comes to our project is how it'll be designed or moreso the expectation to be designed. I also learned a lot about the program will run for the summer which will be very helpful in having a productive experience. I learned a new topic about our project like Sportsbrief AI which highlights how the games will be processed into bite-sized summaries. We also had a proper disscussion of how AI will takeover jobs or not? AI as I know will create more problems but it'll also be able to create more solutions.

blockers: |
  No blockers for today as of right now.

reflection: |
  I actually like this day today especially because of proper human interaction which was way better than being virtual although that also had it's benefits as well. I liked our discussion we had as well being apart of this internship highlights the ability to learn what's going on with AI. I also liked how Dr.Water pointed out non-deterministic values, and the interactive choclate chip cookie activity. The marshmallow game is fun asf especially due to the fact that when it comes down to it my team was able to make sure the marshmallow held up in under 10 seconds. The team building excerises are fun to communicate to each other with.
