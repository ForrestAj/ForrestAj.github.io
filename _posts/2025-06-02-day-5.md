what_i_learned: |
    I learned that when it comes to our project is how it'll be designed or moreso the expectation to be designed. I also learned a lot about the program will run for the summer which will be very helpful in having a productive experience. I learned a new topic about our project like Sportsbrief AI which highlights how the games will be processed into bite-sized summaries.

blockers: |
  The biggest challenge was maintaining a stable Bluetooth connection. The signal would occasionally drop for a second or two, which disrupted the live charting. I plan to explore buffering strategies next. Additionally, I still see low-frequency artifacts from head movement.

reflection: |
  Watching my brainwaves animate in real time felt surreal. It made all the previous setup work worth it. Next, I’ll begin connecting this live data stream to robotic behaviors in NeuroLink Assist—starting with simple directional movement based on concentration strength.
