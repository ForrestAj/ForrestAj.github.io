what_i_learned: |
  Machine Learning is the Machine's abilty to compute and make predictions based on the data provided. Compared to programming, Machine Learning has an input and output that it's given so that it can interpret the rule given the information implemented. Programming is given the rule and the input and thus creates the output. Throwback to the computer vision where we learned image classifaction where it highlighted the thing that was being shown based on the information given. NLP which is the way machines can be able to communicate like humans. As far for our project it highlights what tools we'll use and how we're intergrating everything altogether. Learnt about pandas and how to utilize it's built-in functions like iloc, dataframe. etc.

reflection: |
  I liked how we got into machine learning and It helped me get more educated on the matter. I also like our project so far I do like the group I have with it which is making this more fun. We are just starting to get into the data aspect of our research which is where we'll learn how to read and understand it so we can implement it. Reflecting on what was discussed as of today getting the knowledge of the panda library was helpful as it would be implemented within our project later down the line.
