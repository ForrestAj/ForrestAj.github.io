what_i_learned: |
  We started off the session with honing in our panda skills which gave me a great start in terms of what we'll bw working with using our dataset instead of a kaggle dataset. Learned about sklearn with the implementation of Tensorflow. A new topic that has arrived is API where we need a key in order to access the information that is provided. Now we're implementing our api's in order to utilize them for our project properly. So far what we discussed our leauge and country in the table will be independent and the points and rankings will be our dependent ranking.

reflection: |
  Productive day today, Still in the planning phrase of things as we are now starting to figure out how we'll put things together honestly. I like how we're getting to learn first and then integrate everything that we learned instead of just rushing into it. I do want to look over things as far we progress so I can better contribute to my group. Starting the outline for our research paper helped clarified a few things as we progress within the project over the next couple of weeks.
