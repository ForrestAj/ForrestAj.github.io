what_i_learned: |
  We went on a Campus Tour today understanding where everything comes from and when it was built. I learned that Morgan is very far spread out when walking around the campus. Still tackling our code in order to see what's going on within the seasons and trying to figure out to to get that information to display. Today was very informative in how to handle the issues at hand. Getting the json was the easier part but it's trying to figure out how to get the rest of the information within that json.

  Just getting the information from the seasons section of the API.

reflection: |
  I enjoyed the campus tour it was a great breather from all the research we did so far. I did'nt like all the walking because it was 85 degrees at the time and it made me so tired. The research is getting into the stuff we do need to figure out in order to be able to complete our deliverable this week. I was hoping for the scavenger hunt to be today instead of the tour but either way I enjoyed it.
