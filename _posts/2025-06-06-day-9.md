what_i_learned: |
  Still tackling our code in order to see what's going on within the seasons and trying to figure out to to get that information to display. Today was very informative in how to handle the issues at hand. Getting the json was the easier part but it's trying to figure out how to get the rest of the information within that json. Worked on our weekly report when it comes to our project, It was easy to delegate and figure out who's doing what within the project and what challenges are being dealt. Pointing out how AI is cracking down on sport journalism within this project.

reflection: |
  Today was honestly not much considering we addressed everything we did yesterday but this time we just built on it. Still getting used to Panda and it's functions. Interesting discussion on AI replacing Humans as agents which I'm perplexed on agreeing with. What it comes down to honestly is that there's good and bad within everything going on. I liked how we got started on our report and figured out what we need to build up on what we started.
