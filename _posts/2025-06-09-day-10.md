what_i_learned: |
  I learned a lot more about the natural language processing methods when it comes to interpreting text. The stematization and Lematization is important and breaking up the words and being able to decipher which words are being detected within them. Made some beginner-friendly progress on the research paper that we did so far. Overall I this the process was smooth for today.

reflection: |
  Honestly it was a long process which took up some time not in terms of difficuly but in terms of it's a lot to take in. I'm glad we're learning all this information because it's something that gets glossed over a lot when it comes down to it. Calling on the API is one of the key parts I like about this program so far which is very beneficial to my learning. When it comes to it the issue is within the fact that the information is a lot so if you don't understand one thing then it's a little harder to get to the next.
