what_i_learned: |
  I tackled on how to take the api and get the endpoints to use them. We started off by specifiying the teams individually and taking their ID's so anaylze their perfomance through the season. I'm also learning how to properly call on the endpoints themselves utilizing the URL's when it comes to it. I tried to take on the initiave where all the teams stats are shown which was successful. Also divided the research paper into how AI is impacting the scope withing our project.

  

blockers: |
  I'm still struggling with the API's so far

reflection: |
  We didn't really split tasks we were focused on trying to be able to access our api's and learn a lot about them. It's frustrating when it comes to learning new information but it's very insightful because you're progressing from within. I liked being the carrier for our group helping out with differnt ways to further our goals. Research Paper so far has been starting to pickup.
