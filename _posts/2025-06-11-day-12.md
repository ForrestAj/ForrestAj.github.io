what_i_learned: |
  I learned how to shorten the calling for the API. My mentor helped me looked over the code and taught me an easier way to do it instead of overthinking and coming to the next resort. I learned how the lines of code build on top of one another which helped me understand it a bit better when looking at it. We analyzed how the df works using list and dictionaries and knowing how they're contained. Understanding what we're doing with the information than just using it.

  

blockers: |
  Just acutally looking at the code and figuring out what's the quicker method of things than relying on the long way.

reflection: |
  Today was super productive as we progressed within the information that we're using. I need to enhance my technical background other than solving within. I liked how we're also learning while it's also being fun to do. My group has helped me a lot with coming together and trying to solve the code whilst separately. The process is long but fulfilling.
