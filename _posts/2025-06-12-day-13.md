what_i_learned: |
  Today's activity was a building blocks as we got to communicate with our peers outside of our respective groups which was enriching for me. I also learned about the tool being used with everyone's groups like tkiner, r, matlab, etc. We played Taboo which was very competive for us and it resulted in my team being the winning team partially thanks to me bridging the gap. Taboo really communicates how what you may understand is what someone else might now honestly. Then we started switching to jenga which was cool until I made my team lose so there's that. Then we got started with using Overleaf which is what we'll be using for our Final Paper.

reflection: |
  This was most likely the best day so far considering what we did for the time being was really productive and stress-free. I liked winning a benefit of my choosing with either an hour late or an hour early. The cohort connect helps with being able to relax with all the research that we do and that's something I'm grateful for. Also the progress within our projects is getting clearer and clearer for me to understand which is taking some stress off my back.
