what_i_learned: |
  We dug deeper in our definition of API, and we understood what each abbreviation meant, like csv, html, http etc. We also got more invovled in our goals for the week which was really helpful. I liked how we acomplished the stuff for this week and how we're getting deeper into the pre processing methods. Overall this week was a building enviorment for us and it help us come together as a group. I also learned that training the API is easier said then done when we're working on the summaries of the games and trying to highlight how we're breaking it down.

reflection: |
  Overall this week was a building enviorment for us and it help us come together as a group. I liked being more in-depth with the NLP it's something fresh and new so that we'll be able to keep up and being productive with one another. NLP is like the glue for our project which is why i'm interested in it. Buckling down which was really productive and understanding our goals within the weekly meetup which worked out a lot.
