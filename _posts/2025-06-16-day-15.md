what_i_learned: |
  I learned that when it comes to our fixture ids it's narrowed down to one spefific match which makes it harder to get all the teams matches when calling on the team. Every team has a spefifc fixture id for each match so if we strictly wanted to get that spefific team then it'll have to come from their stats instead. The parameters are very different when it comes to pinpointing certain things that you want. The usage of the API's are limited so when we're trying to fix that information it's easier said than done and we need to lay off for now.

  

blockers: |
  I was confused on the fixture parameters but then I figured out how to manuver it.

reflection: |
  I honestly like the work that we're doing it's like we're getting closer and closer and soon we'll be able to fix all the cracks in place. The API's are actually fundemental to learning about the process of getting the information then training the machine to work with the information that's being given so far. When it comes to dealing with the code it's sometimes frustrating when you're going through multiple notebooks but it's also helpful so it balances out. I'm thankful for this oppurtunity.
