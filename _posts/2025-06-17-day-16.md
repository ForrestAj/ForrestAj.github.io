what_i_learned: |
  Further highlighting the strengths on how AI is impacting sport journalism within this project. The progress on the research paper that we did so far is fairly significant when it comes to trying to developed our findings and explanations. The parameters are very different when it comes to pinpointing certain things that you want which now makes for even more difficult. Further worked on yesterdays code and further improved on our understanding of what's going on.

reflection: |
  I liked how we're building up on our report with the sports journalism and AI because our findings have gotten better. Working on yesterday's code has been very interesting to figure out how we're doing within the scope of putting everything all together. Figuring out what to do next has been the more curious part of this ecperience. Today was just building on our foundation within what we did yesterday which was helpful in progressing in the project.
