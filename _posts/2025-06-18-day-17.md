what_i_learned: |
  Our high school teacher has been introduced to us and we played a guessing game to fish out our teacher. Practiced the pitches earlier which helped us explain our project better without explaining it directly. Then we went straight into survival mode which helped us figure out how we would survive in a titanic like experience which helped us figured out how to be able to survive and rank important things. We did another icebreaker with our new addtion to get acclimated to her and understand where she comes from. We explained and further went into depth with our project and gave a refresher of how our project will work and what's being applied to it.

  I enjoyed our interactions with the high school teacher which gave us a much need relaxing period and that was very productive. I also liked the refresher that we did when it came to explaining our project to the high school teacher and how it's being applied and with the application it was very helpful because of the fact that we get better with explaining it. Another I noticed is that earlier in the program I noticed that the structre was built to balance out with the synposium and being able to. Overall it was honestly a nice day when it comes to the program itself.
