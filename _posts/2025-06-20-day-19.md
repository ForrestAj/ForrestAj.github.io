what_i_learned: |
  I learned how to get the fixtures for indiviual teams and not just soley one team. Solved getting the fixture id for multiple matches not just a signular match. Recaping what we did within our team this week which was helpful in preparing for the synopsium. Learned about how f-strings work, understanding more within the project code we're doing. Now we're prepraring how machine learning will be used when it comes to preparing the information that's being stored.

  

blockers: |
  Again some difficulty with trying to get all the teams to process through in the code

reflection: |
  I honestly liked how we're getting closer to our accomplishments because it shows the growth we made so far. Bringing everything together helps with being able to figure out how we plan our next steps accordingly. When it comes to the project its a team builder which I enjoy as we can all learn from each other. Overall this week was good and the addition of the new teacher was exciting as we continue to venture in this program.
