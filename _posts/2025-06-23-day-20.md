what_i_learned: |
  I learned the parts of the formatting when it came to designing how we wanted the information to be. We got to working on the code for how we wanted the summaries to look. Another part of the code that we worked on is when it came to figuring out how we're going to be able to code plenty of matches. Now we got it to be able to update on the file itself so that we'll be able to load and reload the information coming down to it. Then the matches itself or the events rather have their own nested information once I checked out the file.

  

blockers: |
  Not understanding how the display of the code worked earlier which definitely caught me off guard in terms of presenting it on friday. 

reflection: |
  Honestly a real eye opener when it comes to how the work is going so far. I was definetly caught off guard so I'll make sure to keep my eye open when it comes to making sure I understand the work and not just being happy that it works. The summaries are long so figuring out how to make it bite-sized for the video will defintely be a task to be able to work on init of itself but I'm confident that we cane get through it. The data is lengthy but my main issue is how we're putting it altogether so that it can hit the metrics.
