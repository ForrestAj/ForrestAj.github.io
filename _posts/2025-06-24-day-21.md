what_i_learned: |
  I did some summaries in order to train the AI on how to deliver them into bite-sized enetertaining videos. I also collected all the finds we did for individual teams when it comes from the API documentation. I learned a little bit more about data science and how numpy is being used which was helpful in not only understanding my project but other with the presentation. The process was defintely not an easy one in terms of what has happened so far because of the fact that we had to take not only the Open AI key but then connect that within the the api football information so it knows what to get. 

  

blockers: |
  Only when it came to learning about Numpy and how it works not bad but defintely could be better.

reflection: |
  Today was productive as usual, even with out little numpy lecture game it was still very informative. Interacting with group 3 and seeing what they're doing really made me motivated to work on my project harder. The summaries are difficult when you're trying to convey excitement instead of facts when you haven't watch all the games that went on in the season. I think the help with understanding our code and being able to understand some of the libaries we used will help us progress even further in the topic ahead.
