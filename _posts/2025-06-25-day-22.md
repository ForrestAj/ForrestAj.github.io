what_i_learned: |
  I did some summaries in order to train the AI on how to deliver them into bite-sized enetertaining pieces to feed to. Gave the user context in how we wanted to be able to get the summaries done and then worked on fine tuning the deliveries for it. For the most part the summaries have to be properly coordinated with the output and then be able to fix that and figure it out. I think when it comes to the synposium we'll be prepared with the extra time to display what we're doing.

reflection: |
  It was more relaxed considering we worked on what we did yesterday with the fine tuning. The AI is taking some of the context but it's struggles with the interactions but we'll be able to fix that no doubt about it. When it comes to how we're figuring out piecing everything together its coming along smoothly. Overall the summaries we're probably the least time consuming part when it came to getting the summaries.
