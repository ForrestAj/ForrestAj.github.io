what_i_learned: |
  Today I prepared for our presentation going over the slides and preparing our data for the presentation. Met up with our teacher where she did a solid check-in to see where we at with our project. Went over our basics with AI and Machine Learning and understanding what it's meant to do. Double checked our information making sure what needed to be fixed and where it needed to be fixed. Worked out on planning out how we're woking on the demo. Just analyzed the information that was being uploaded into the json to call on when we're working with the API.

  I was just trying to figure out how to be able to work on the demo itself and what we're presenting

reflection: |
  This helped out alot because of the fact that we're able to reevaluate how we're going to work on our presentations and fix it. The teacher meeting helped out with boosting our morale with the project that we're working on. When it comes to the presentation the only thing I'm worried about is making sure I can explain the information well which will help me be albe to understand what's going on within it. Reviewing the code helped out a great deal because of the fact that I can understand what's going on better.
