what_i_learned: |
  I went over the structure of our project and how we're doing every step in order to get the output that we want. Went over our weekly videos and explained what we did over the week, like generating our summaries for our sportsreport matches. Started thinking about what I contributed to the group for our mid-summer synopsium and wrote it on our slides to prepare. Then our next step helped us do the recording which was helped understanding how we would incorporate the audio that is used for today.

reflection: |
  This week was very productive in boosting the morale and preparing for our presentation. Looking back on our progess we came a long way from where we started still get stuck on some prior stuff but honestly we can review it over and over to get better. Looking at what's going on with the project we planned to find a method where we can be able to integrate our own personal recording to be able to save to each generated summary. Overall it comes to buckling down on what we need to be able to do in order to be able to finish up our final touches for the presentation.
