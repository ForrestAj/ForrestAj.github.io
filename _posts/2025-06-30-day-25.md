what_i_learned: |
  We're working on fine tuning the summaries and making sure that they're being generated properly. The AI keeps refreshing new summaries and yet on the previous times I ran it but when I tried to change it back to the orignal prompt it wasn't working. Where also trying to configure how the text to speech will be worked in with the generated summaries. I'm leaving early because I don't feel good so thats all for now.

  

blockers: |
  Keeping the same summary every time I run it which is weird but that's our other hurdle so far

reflection: |
  It was good to keep me on my toes and make sure that I'm able to be consistent in making these issues be fixed. When it comes to the processing portion of what I'm able to do it's very irritating at times but I can make it work. Another thing is preparing for the synopsium which is making sure that the information gets buckled down and I'm prepared to present it. Overall day could've been better which happens in research type enviorments.
