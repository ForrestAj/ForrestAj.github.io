what_i_learned: |
  Went over what we'll be doing for the mid-summer synposium and touched up on any issues we might have beforehand when it comes to our presentation. Worked on saving our summaries to the file so it can be consistent throughout. Then we decided toadd the venues and home and away goals so that we'll be able to get a more accurate read on what's going on. Mainly figuring out how we want the summaries and presentation to go we have most of the things figured out but we'll also try working out the plan of attack to be prepared for anything tomorrow. 

  

blockers: |
  Figuring out how to fine tune the summaries so it stays consistent. I'm also struggling with making the saved summaries remain the same throughout all the generated summaries because it keeps processing new ones with the same stats one time then another time the stats are incorrect.

reflection: |
  Productive nothing more nothing less. I'm making progress with making sure the generated information is accurate but there's still some hiccups along the way. I feel nervous for the presentation but confident in a sense knowing the information the best of my ability. Working on what ever needs to be called in the information from our data findings.
