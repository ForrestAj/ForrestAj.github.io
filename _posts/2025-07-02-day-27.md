what_i_learned: |
  We did more touching up and tying up those loose end so we'll be able to give more consistent presentation of our findings so far. Noticed that when it comes to citing the reviews they have a section where you can highlight your information which is actually very useful. Talked over how we'll be presenting the live demo which took some time to be broken down into pieces. Reviewed how me and my team members should present the information for tomorrow.

  

blockers: |
  Difficulty having to present and format the information thats being presented.

reflection: |
  The review should have been more earlier although we did build on it prior to piecing it altogether. The research has been paying off so far and when it comes down to actually learning. When it comes to the presentation the nerves are definitely present but with time and double checking what we're doing within our presentation will become much better. I also feel prepared because the consisten reivew has helped us do better.
