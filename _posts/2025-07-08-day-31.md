what_i_learned: |
 We updated our AI generated summary which gave a more define and interactive tune when it came to how the matches are announced. I worked on trying to figure out how much tokens would be used so it would still be consiced yet be able to display the information throughout. Decided that coqui was going to be the model used in order to generate that text to speech and then planned on how we'll use our voices to be able to have that as the audio. Worked on finding a way to generate all the team within a certain league that's being responsible.

 None today considering I was up to speed for that portion of what we're doing. 

reflection: |
 I was up to speed when it came to being able to get all the teams for a certain league that's being played. Understanding how to figure out the audio production is going to be tricky but I'm sure with our mentor we'll be able to figure it out. Then when it comes to that approach I'll be prepared and thus figured out what I wanted to do for that day. I feel accomplished with getting all the hiccups so far out of the way which we didn't think about prior.
