what_i_learned: |
 Worked on finally coming to a decision that we should do it in a way where the api calls on a specific league and the get all the matches that way. Worked on being able to get the commentary to voice 2 people instead of one did'nt work on training it yet. The knowledge we know so far is helping carry us and think quickly on how to proceed with things which is clearing up those issues. Shared with my group the information that we needed.

reflection: |
 I liked how we took an approach on how to handle certain things that needed to be worked on which resulted in being able to work quicker. Adding new steps along the way which is hindering our progress but will make the project better because those key things we missed being fixed helps. Then on top of that coming together with how the next steps of the project was enriching to our learning because in these enviorments we'll be able to work on this. Overall these next few weeks are going to be busy and we'll be able to take pride in something that we did.
