what_i_learned: |
 I learned about the process of writing a research paper which takes a lot of time and effort. The writing center helped provide with a lot of things which was helpful in the process of doing the actual work. Going over what is invovled inside of a research paper along with how to truly understand the fundamentals of writing itself. We went over statement lines and background context which provided the insight towards the audience when it comes to our research project. Buckling down on our recording with the 2 audios without conflicting at the same time which was getting smoother to handle

 Finding a way to incorporate AI within our title while making it short. 

reflection: |
 Overall today was more interactive which was helping us get more in depth within the research paper. Then we're also getting information in how we can progress in this program even further. Not only that we're also able to produce as a more cohesive front which results in being able to get more eyes in on our project. When it comes to figuring out how to develop our research paper it was hard but with this workshop intro it helped point out the key things within our project.
