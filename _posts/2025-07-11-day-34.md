what_i_learned: |
 This week was more so an understanding of what we did since the beginning and how we're going to tie it up in the end. We started locking all the information we got into the API and started calling on it from our saved csv and json which reduced the constant calling on the API. I also was able to work on being able to called the summaries and finish up fine-tuning our project for that part so far. Towards the end the issue was mainly being able to progress within our next steps that will then call on to the coqui tts model and be able to then get the 2 audios for one summary. Honestly figuring out what our project needs extra of going to be the obstacle for the next couple of weeks along with the research paper which is hefty.

 Trying to figure out what our project needs so that it stands out while being consistent with the format of our project already. Not being hard on myself about that but I hope to figure it out.

reflection: |
 I was caught up to speed from what I missed on monday which helped with assimilating into the project itself which is helpful especially considering what's going on within the project. Figuring out what our project needs besides the information to make us stand out from other sports like information that'll be a tough task within itself. Now it's just getting the lose ends tighten up which is more of a priority now more than ever for these next couple of weeks. Honestly it's been a smooth but a more cautious approach with these next few weeks.
