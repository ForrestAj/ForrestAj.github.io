what_i_learned: |
 Worked on recording the summaries for the AI, which was most of the day's work so far. Then we worked on how we wanted our frontend to look for the project which was a rough sketch. Working on improving our introduction on the research paper because we noticed on our rough draft that we can improve it. Took what we learned from part 1 of the workshop which helped us out a lot. Noticed that our progression is getting stagnant with what we're working on but hopefully we can improve on that which would help us out a lot better when it comes to certian things needing to be done. Overall a regular progression within our research.

reflection: |
 Today was just a regular progression of what should be done and what has been done so far. Looking back I'm engaged on what we have been doing so far because it's a very entertaining topic and I do enjoy my time working on it with the group. With research it's a lot of trial and error which is finding out what works and what doesn't work.Honestly I just need to buckle down some more and try to handle future problems we might face.
