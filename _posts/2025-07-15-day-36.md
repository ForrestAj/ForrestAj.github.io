what_i_learned: |
 Worked on recording the summaries for the AI, which was most of the day's work so far. Then we worked on how we wanted our frontend to look for the project which was a rough sketch. Working on improving our introduction on the research paper because we noticed on our rough draft that we can improve it. Learned about our MTBI and Learning Styles for our cohort connect which was very fun and interactive. Doing the gallery walk learning about the other groups projects which was fun and interactive. Noticing how the other groups reallt mesh well within their enviorment and having individual strengths and weaknesses.

reflection: |
 Hopefully we do another overleaf tutorial since we'll be using that for our research paper unfortunately it didn't happen today. Today was refreshing because it's been awhile since we've interacted together in the cohort connect which boosted my morale. As far as the work with the recordings and research paper it's standard work for the most part which was the more bulk. I want to figure out what our project is missing to make it stand out because I'm not sure where that will be coming from. It's really 16 days left until the final presentation and hopefully my group does good and we kill it by the Grace of God.
