what_i_learned: |
 Worked on coming up with a predictive analysis based on the previous matches and seasons within a teams performance. Worked on finally finishing up the recording to train our model which was a relief. Reviewed on working our directory when it comes to being able to get all the information we've collected in our Google drive (for now). Now we're starting to train the model with the realistic human voices that we need. Accomplished sectioning what information from our literature reviews that we'll be using on our research paper.

  Stuck on trying to place where this analysis would be able to fit into our project. Just figuring out when we're going to work on the front and back end of the project.

reflection: |
 I like this idea so far considering that it would help give us a push to break out of that predictable mold. Working on how the information we stored would be retrived is just us getting one step closer when it comes to being able to showcase what we have so far. Working on implementing tnew ideas is refreshing considering that we've been working on this project for weeks but not to the point where it slows us down. Concentrating on the research paper has also been a blessing because now we know the directory and ironing out the kinks of our paper.
