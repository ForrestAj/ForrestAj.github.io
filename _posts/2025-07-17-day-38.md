what_i_learned: |
 Learned about how to point out the shortcomings within the article and then being able to summarize what the article is about and understanding it. Great knowledge on how publications are very import in the research status so far when it comes to undergraduates and how this can be very benefical. Worked on writing our summary about the study that we're doing and being able to defend our claims on the study and highlight those areas that we can cover within our research. Finally finishing training the model based on the recordings that we did resulting in us getting through another hurdle within this project.

 

blockers: |
 Dealing with coming through on the research paper which was one of the main issues I had when writing the summary on the study. Double Checking our study within each of the literature reviews that we had so far.

reflection: |
 The workshop was actually helpful because it really emphasizes the importance of what you're really doing in this field which makes you more credibile. Dr.Pandey was really entertaining within the workshop so it didn't feel like a bore honestly and I can actually learn the information that I can then carry on within our team. Now it's time to make sure that this project hits all the checkpoints that it needs to hit in order to successfully produce the things we have to produce. I'm excited to show the progress we made hopefully we're able to provide a different perspective when it comes to being able to do this. Overall I can't believe that we're almost coming to the end of our program it's closer than I even imagined.
