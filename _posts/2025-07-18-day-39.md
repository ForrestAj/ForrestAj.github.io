what_i_learned: |
 After working on all the voice recordings throughout the week we started training the model with our realistic voices. Trying to figure out if the model would be able to work with colab but then realized that it runs on GPU instead of CPU so that was the hurdle fixed. Finding out the TTS model may not work with the amount of heavy files we have so far which is already one of our roadblocks. Then just knowninlgy having to finish up these short end at once which is a lot in it of itself.

 

blockers: |
  Issues with TTS Model accepting more files than just one or better yet the amount we have.

reflection: |
 Honestly I can't believe that the time is nearing which is a lot because we've been doing this for 39 days and counting. I'm glad we finished our biggest hurdle yet so that we can conquer the rest of the project. Hopefully I can figure out the TTS model issue soon so that we can already be done with that because now we're on crunch time. Next week is just making sure that we clean-up everything just so we know that it's presentation time.
