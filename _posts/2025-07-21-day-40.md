what_i_learned: |
 Worked on how to use overleaf when it comes to working on what we built so far so that we can properly display it for the final research paper. Buckling down on any major issue within our paper and working through those kinks and issues as well helping us out. Worked on merging the recordings so that the voice cloning can give us a reasonable output. Transitioning our paper to the overleaf model just fixing the kinks on the regualr draft and putting it into the model itself.

reflection: |
 I enojyed the overleaf tutorial which helped us out with a lot of issues that we just can lock in and focus on when it comes to producing the research paper. Working on the paper itself is just figuring out how to properly phrase it and structure it honestly. The voice cloning is getting better with handling it's just with colab it's very on and off resulting in various issues that happen on and off. Methodlogy is going well so far the only thing is just emphasizing the points into a even better dialouge when it comes down to it.
