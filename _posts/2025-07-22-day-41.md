what_i_learned: |
 When it comes to the coqui TTS model it resulted in using every model trying to get the best results and see which model worked. The work when it came to being able to figure out how to get the voice cloning to work was very tedious and trial and error seeing which one worked the best and which one worked the worst. Then fine-tuning the methodlogy where the real work came to the research paper. The reseacrch paper was just coming together when it came to structuring it and wondering how it was going to be built. Worked on how we wanted the elevator picth to be looked at and just how we're going to portray it to get others interested.

 The Voice Cloning was very difficult because of the fact we're figuring out how we want it to process smoothly without any kinks being present. Just coming up with a solid elevator pitch that we would all be comfortable with.

reflection: |
 I'm frustrated when iot comes to the voice cloning because of how we wanted to be able to progress and then it being very inconsistent on certain days. Buckling down on the methodology was our top priority because that's how you get to convey the work that you're being able to do. It's was a realization coming in when we seen how much time is passing and then being able to just enjoy this oppurtunity for what it was. Working on being able to figure out what the next finalization type steps are because we realized what's done and what need to be fixed next. Overall the production of the day was solid but tiring.
