what_i_learned: |
 Worked on the elevator pitch that we agreed on and had a lot of fun doing. Putting effort instead of being boring made it fun and interactive to do and hopefully the pitch comes out good. Contiued to put some effort into the literature review as we developed our findings more than just the topic itself and were able to put our method we produced to use. Analyzing the shortcomings and what we learned from it has been helpful and further more the project is strengthed in that aspect. 

 

blockers: |
 Too much reading so I got mixed up with some of the information.

reflection: |
 I can't believe that the end is approaching it was like just yesterday we're introducing ourselves to each other and now we're finally finishing up. The elevator pitch was really one of the highlights while making the project which was shown to be very impressive getting into the fold. Not only that it's getting me more relaxed when it comes to being on camera and authenically presenting what you're working on. Overall this day was fun and productive considering we killed two birds with one stone.
