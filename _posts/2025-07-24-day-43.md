what_i_learned: |
 Learned that citiaion when it comes to literature reviews is easier said than done. The first version of our TTS model was at 0.4 accuracy when it comes to getting the voice down properly for the project. Looking at not only how AI Impacts Sports but the TTS models that we're also doing which provided a clearer example of what we're working on. Now it's mainly transferring it to overleaf and being able to properly cite the information that I'm utilizing from these other articles. Cleaning up those tweaks when it comes to our research paper. 

 

blockers: |
 Not citing or mentioning the information properly which was a huge mistake on my end. Branching out new articles outside of the ones that I wanted to do.

reflection: |
 It's frustrating when it comes to these literature reviews because that's not my strongest suit. Not getting discouraged when it comes to this aspect and making sure our TTS model works properly because of the fact that it's so short in time. I wished we branched out on problems individually a bit earlier but considering we're a team the working together does help out a lot. I hope that we can add the few things that we have left to add which would be a big relief to some of the stress I've been facing so far.
