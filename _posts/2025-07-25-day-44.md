what_i_learned: |
 I learned that Brain-Computing was established in the 1960's which is very old than what I expected because it's very present in todays world. The brain waves used have a lot of different meanings like Gamma for clenching, Delta for blinking, Alpha when you're relaxed. Applied that logic to the drones and robots we did in our workshop for today and understood how structured it was when it came down to it. Also when you use two people for the robots with the muscle interaction it's very weird because the readings are very inconsistent when the machine doesn't know what to go based off on. Worked on finalizing the steps when it comes to the slideshows which was very important for our Final Presentation.

reflection: |
 I actually enjoyed the workshop because it's easier to learn about things when you're actually interacting with them because then you can understand the process better compared to someone telling you. Human Computer Interaction is definitely something that I plan to look into for the future because it's fun and an educational process. My favorite one was using the brain waves for the drones because it was like having telepathic superpowers although you did input instructions for how it should work. The slideshow preparations is going well when it comes to being able to know what we want to inform the audience what the presentation is about. Overall today was a relaxing and productive day because we're still going smoothly but having fun with the fact these workshops are fun and informative
