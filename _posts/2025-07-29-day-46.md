what_i_learned: |
 It's been a lot of work when it comes to our research paper and figuring out what we'll be able to accomplish and not accomplish because of the time we have left. Working on getting the literature reviews and getting that altogether because it's the lengthiest part of the process. Finishing up our slides so that we'll only have the live demo to work on. Getting a practice presentation in tomorrow so that we'll be able to convey our presentation. Generating a fine tuned audio convo would've been nice but some of it worked better than others and others didn't work properly.

 

blockers: |
 Not being able to sort out all the research papers earlier and then fully being able to flesh out the audio.

reflection: |
 I can't believe it's coming to an end soon which is bittersweet in itself. Just being able to get this experience has helped me be better because I didn't know how to do research to this extent which is good. It's stressful because being able to get everything done was quite difficult and then at that point we weren't accomplished with certain things that would've been nice to have. As far as the literature revies we've been getting good progress but it's been a hassle to make sure the citation is being done properly. Overall this session was productive but at the end of the day there's room for growth.
