what_i_learned: |
 Reviewing all the work throughout the ten weeks was very eventful considering the amount of work we put in. Working over what we want to present in the live demo for the much new updated progress throughout. Recapping the work we did prior in the beginning so that we don't lose the understanding of that foundation and we'll be able to explain anything prior to the new information being presented. Getting everything lined up when it comes to the research paper so that we'll be able to transfer it into overleaf.

reflection: |
 It's been a chaotic 47 days with the amount of work that we did and the connections we built throughout the program. I'm truly grateful for this oppurtunity and the way it's presented itself as an oppurtuinity to enhance my research experience. Working on this presentation to make sure that everything runs as well is the highlight of this day so far because of the fact that it's preparing us for the real world where we'll be doing this in our careers. I actually liked working with my group a lot because we've built that community together all through these ten weeks.
