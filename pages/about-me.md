  bio: |
    I currently have studied Computer Science at Morgan State University, I'm trying to restrengthen some of the stuff I'm rusty on.

    My Studies gear towards learning how to assess technical problems and knowing how to solve them especially within the software of computer and technology, I have assisted in Technical Services but haven't explored outside of my scope.

    When I’m not working on research, I enjoy watching wrestling, working out, and trying new things.
