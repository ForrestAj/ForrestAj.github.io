subtitle: Research: FIFA Club World Cup 2025
project_title: "Developing Post-game content using AI for automated soccer box scores and video news reportsg"

problem: |
  The project addresses the increasing demand for quick, accurate sports highlights while offering
students valuable hands-on experience in rapidly growing fields.

  By working with live match data, creating automated box scores, and generating one-minute video news segments, students will gain practical skills in machine learning, natural language processing, and audio synthesis.

approach: |
  the AI/ML and/or tools to be used and their applications in the project.

  - Transformers Library: Core technology for natural language processing (NLP), including text
summarization and text-to-speech tasks.
  - Deep Learning Frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow): Training and deploying custom
machine learning models for text analysis and audio generation.
  - Data Handling and Analysis (pandas, NumPy):Efficiently collecting, cleaning, and manipulating
real-time match data to provide accurate input for downstream ML tasks.
  - Audio/Voice Synthesis Tools:Transforming written summaries into natural-sounding voice-overs
using deep learning-based text-to-speech systems.
  - Version Control Systems (e.g., GitHub, GitLab):Managing the projectâ€™s collaborative
development, code reviews, and iterative improvements.

  Open-source tools such as OpenBCI, Python (MNE, Scikit-learn), and ROS (Robot Operating System) will be used to prototype the system.

outcome: |
  Demonstrated Competency in AI/ML Fundamentals. Functional Summarization and Text-to-Speech Pipeline. Strong Collaboration and Communication Skills. Comprehensive Final Presentation and Documentation Final project report detailing technical approaches, challenges, and lessons learned
