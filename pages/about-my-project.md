project_title: "Developing Post-Game Content Using AI for Automated Soccer Box Scores and Video News Reports"

problem: |
  This project addresses the growing demand for quick, accurate sports highlights while offering students valuable hands-on experience in rapidly advancing fields.

  By working with live match data to create automated box scores and generate one-minute video news segments, students will develop practical skills in machine learning, natural language processing, and audio synthesis.

approach: |
  This project leverages AI/ML tools to automate and enhance post-game content production:

  - **Transformers Library**: Core technology for natural language processing (NLP), including tasks like text summarization and text-to-speech.
  - **Deep Learning Frameworks** (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow): For training and deploying custom models for text analysis and audio generation.
  - **Data Handling and Analysis Tools** (e.g., pandas, NumPy): For efficiently collecting, cleaning, and processing real-time match data.
  - **Audio/Voice Synthesis Tools**: Used to convert written summaries into natural-sounding voice-overs.
  - **Version Control Systems** (e.g., GitHub, GitLab): To support collaborative development, code reviews, and iterative improvements.

  They will analyze past soccer matches summary from sport news outlet to create authentic game summaries for the model

outcome: |
  - Demonstrated competency in AI/ML fundamentals.
  - A fully functional summarization and text-to-speech pipeline.
  - Strong collaboration and communication skills.
  - A comprehensive final presentation and detailed technical documentation.
